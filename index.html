        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>meta defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport</li>
          <li>src attribute defines the location of an image</li>
          <li>alt attribute contains a text string that descrives the apperance and functionality of the image</li>
          <li>a tag is anchor and creates links to a webpage</li>
          <li>href attribute points to the URL for a link</li>
          <li>Takeaway: Use semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Inline CSS - to style an element directly in the HTML file using the "style" attribute</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet - contains CSS rules for the webage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External style sheet - most common, keeps all CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>Declaration - contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Class attribute - allows us to share a CSS rule to any element we chosse by assiging the rule to a class attribute with a class selector: card</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
          <li>Function - is simply a set of instruction that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li> A function must be called before it can function</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensetive.</li>
          <li>Semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>/* Everything inbetween is a a comment*/</li>
          <li>// This is a comment</li>
          <li>String - a sequence of text enclosed in a single or double quotation marks</li>
          <li>Boolean - True/False value, special keywords that do not need quotations</li>
          <li>Array - structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>Object - this can be anything, everything in Javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          <li>=== performs a text to see if two values are equal, it returns a Boolean result</li>
          <li>!. !== returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes; it turns a true into a false.  When used alongside the equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal</li>
